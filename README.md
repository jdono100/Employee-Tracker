## Description

A CLI JavaScript app that can keep track of a large number of employees and their roles/departments. Made using the node packages inquirer, MySQL, chalk, and console.table.


## Installation


  This app requires MySQL to be installed in order to work. Download the repo and run `npm i` in the console once navigated to the downloaded directory. 

Rename the `'.env.Example'` file to just `'.env'` and save. Once installed, you will have to copy/paste the `'employee_db.sql'` and `'seed.sql'` in MySQL Workbench, or run them in the command line.


## Usage

After everything is installed, just type `npm start` into the command line after navigating to the downloaded directory.

If you're running a company with a lot of employees, this app could make life easier as it can be run at any time and can delete employees as well as whole departments.
